      removes the old way of filtering namespaces to be watched with a more intuitive
      way: instead of using concepts like `allowlist` or `blocklist`, one can just
      set `true` or `false` in the new `watchNamespacesByDefault`.  The old labels
      used to filter them are now dropped in favor of just `operator.cnwan.io/watch`
      with values `enabled` or `disabled`. Please refer to our documentation to know
      how this works.  The old, deprecated way to provide options for Google Service
      Directory is now definitively removed and some other packages have been removed
      as well, making the project slimmer and smoother.  Some other improvements are
      also present. '

      makes it easier for you to deploy the operator on your cluster as it does not
      need any dependency injected into it anymore, i.e. `ConfigMap`s and `Secret`s
      will now be automatically retrieved by the operataor from the cluster.  Additionally,
      in case you are running the operator on *GKE* and choosing to use *Service Directory*
      you may now leave some of the settings empty and the operator will detect your
      project ID and region automatically and therefore set up *Service Directory*
      without you having to touch anything. '
