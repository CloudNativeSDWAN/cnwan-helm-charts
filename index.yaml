    description: 'Register and manage your Kubernetes Services to a Service Registry.  `v0.5.0`
      makes it easier for you to deploy the operator on your cluster as it does not
      need any dependency injected into it anymore, i.e. `ConfigMap`s and `Secret`s
      will now be automatically retrieved by the operataor from the cluster.  Additionally,
      in case you are running the operator on *GKE* and choosing to use *Service Directory*
      you may now leave some of the settings empty and the operator will detect your
      project ID and region automatically and therefore set up *Service Directory*
      without you having to touch anything. '
