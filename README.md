## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.10+
- Helm 3.1.0

### Install Helm

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” *Helm Charts* help you define,
install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install)
and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.

### Add Repo

Run this command to download -- and later install -- all the charts from this
repository:

```bash
helm repo add cnwan https://CloudNativeSDWAN.github.io/cnwan-helm-charts
```

### Install charts

As of now, this repository allows you to install the *CN-WAN Operator*.

There are multiple ways to install it on your cluster, and all are based
on this command:

```bash
helm install cnwan-operator cnwan/cnwan-operator <settings>
```

Please refer to *CN-WAN Operator*'s [chart guide](./cnwan-operator/README.md)
to learn more about the installation process and its
[official repository](https://github.com/CloudNativeSDWAN/cnwan-operator) for
